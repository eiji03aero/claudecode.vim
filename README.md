# claudecode.vim

Yeah, everyone left vim for neovim... What can I say?

A Vim plugin that integrates Claude Code CLI with Vim, providing seamless interaction between the editor and Claude's AI capabilities.

Heavily inspired by: https://github.com/coder/claudecode.nvim

Pretty much intended for personal use.
